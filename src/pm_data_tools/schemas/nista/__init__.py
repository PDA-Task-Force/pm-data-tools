"""NISTA (National Infrastructure and Strategic Transport Agency) placeholder.

NISTA is the UK government standard for infrastructure project data, launched
in December 2025. This module is a placeholder awaiting the official schema
release.

Once the official NISTA schema is published, this module will provide:
- Parser for NISTA data files
- Writer to export to NISTA format
- Validator for NISTA compliance

For now, use the GMPP parser as NISTA is expected to build upon GMPP standards.
